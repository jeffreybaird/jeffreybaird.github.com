Hello!

Today we are going to look at a little basic HTML. I'm running behind so this will be a short post.

This is what a (super) basic HTML file looks like:

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-15-at-11.14.11-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31" title="HTML as Text File" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-15-at-11.14.11-PM.png" alt="" width="549" height="427" /></a>

This is what that file looks like on a web browser:

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30" title="HTML in Browser" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Screen-Shot-2012-02-15-at-11.08.57-PM.png" alt="" width="1280" height="447" />
<h2>Homework:</h2>
Your homework for tonight is to compare the two and make a guess as to what each tag does. Tomorrow we will go over it.
