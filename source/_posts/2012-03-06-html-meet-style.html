Sorry for the unannounced absence. Life gets in the way.

Let's look back at what we have learned so far:

First, we learned about how to secure a d<a title="For My First Lesson: My Digital Resume" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/13/for-my-first-lesson-my-digital-resume/">omain name and set up hosting</a>.

Next, I introduced you to <a title="Lesson 2: An Intro to HTML" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/14/lesson-2-an-intro-to-html/">HTML</a> and how it fits in the web.

After that, I showed you what a simple <a title="A Quick Look at HTML and Your First Assignment" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/16/a-quick-look-at-html-and-your-first-assignment/">HTML document looks</a> like.

Finally, I showed you how to set up your <a title="Setting Up Your Website" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/20/setting-up-your-website/">text editor</a> and your website's folder.

Today we are going to learn some basic styling and introduce the "style" element to your HTML document. NEWS FLASH: It is no longer 1999 and we can't use HTML to style our webpages...Gasp.

I know that is common knowledge to most people in web design, but don't roll your eyes at me. It is a misconception many beginners carry.

I won't be teaching any CSS today, just showing you where it fits in and what it does.

So let's go back to the code from the earlier lesson:

[caption id="attachment_41" align="alignnone" width="475" caption="Straight HTML"]<a href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.41.14-PM1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46" title="HTML" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.41.14-PM1.png" alt="" width="475" height="519" /></a>[/caption]

That code gave us this web page:

<a href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.56.13-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44" title="Unformatted Website" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.56.13-PM-300x206.png" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></a>

Now take a look at the same code with a little CSS thrown in:

<a href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.45.19-PM1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47" title="HTML with CSS" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.45.19-PM1.png" alt="" width="520" height="660" /></a>

Notice that I threw in a "Style" tag. The tag has an attribute, text/css. This tells the browser that we will be styling the website with CSS. I won't tell you exactly what each one does, try to figure it out based on the picture below.

<a href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.56.02-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-43" title="Website Styled with CSS" src="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-1.56.02-PM-300x210.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a>

So what did the CSS accomplish?
