<h2>Today's Lesson</h2>
<h3>Setting up your website</h3>
In order to begin creating your website you have to first choose a text editor. If you have a Mac you can use TextEdit. If you have a PC, Notepad comes standard. Thanks to <a href="http://www.redheadjessica.com">Jessica</a> I will be using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> which is a text editor made specially for developers.

So open up the text editor of your choice and make sure that it is set to a plain text format (not necessary if using TextMate)

Save the file as "index.html" to a folder called "learnwithjeff."

Now, try creating a file like the one I did in my <a title="A Quick Look at HTML and Your First Assignment" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/16/a-quick-look-at-html-and-your-first-assignment/">previous post</a>. Once you have finished open the file using your browser and check out your first HTML website!
