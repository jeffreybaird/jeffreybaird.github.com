<h2>I'm coming back now, I promise</h2>
I'm sorry, audience of zero, I haven't been updating you on my learning process or helping you keep up. The problem is, I have been moving way too fast to write about it every day. So, to update you:
<h3>HTML:</h3>
While I am no master, I plowed through my HTML book and felt comfortable enough to move on.
<h3>CSS:</h3>
I know the concepts of CSS, I know what it can do and I know where to look up commands, I think I will get better by doing.

So the blog originally was for you to learn with me and I dropped the ball on keeping up with it. Sorry.

So, Where am I now?
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
I have been playing around with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> for a few months now and I love it. The exercises are challenging and you have a lot of freedom to mess around. It was a great intro to programming and I have since expanded my pursuits!
<h3>Ruby</h3>
Through the urging of my wonderful friends <a href="http://redheadjessica.com/">Jessica Barnett</a> and <a href="http://aubreygoodman.wordpress.com/">Aubrey Goodman</a>, I decided to pursue Ruby. I love it. Actually love is a gross understatement. When I sleep, I have dreams of objects and methods dancing in my head (you think I'm joking).

I am currently working my way through the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program">Learn to Program by Chris Pine</a> (highly recommend) and a course offered by <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby">Pragmatic Studios</a> (equally awesome).

Needless to say, I don't want to do anything else but program in Ruby for the foreseeable future.
<h3>General Computer Science</h3>
For this I am reading <a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=debautblo-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=0071460519">Schaum's Outline</a> which moves really fast but is completely worth the effort. I think this will prepare me well for some further exploration into algorithms and databases.
<h3>Java</h3>
I am also going through<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111"> Standford's Intro to Programming Methodology and Computer Science </a>class to hopefully give me some training in larger theories and best practices of software design.

So, yes I am busy. I will however try to post more often with some tidbits, challenges and advice I pick up along the way. I hope you continue to read!
