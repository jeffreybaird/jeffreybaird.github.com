Full of the knowledge gained from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb/events/60266012/" target="_blank">Coder Night</a> on Thursday, I made an attempt at creating a poker game. My original plan was to create three classes, a Player class, a Deck class and a Game class. The general construction of the game would be the Game class would use take a new deck object and pop the last card out of the shuffled array and assign it to one of the players in the array "hand"

The first problem I ran into was getting each player cards from the same deck. When I wrote the program the first time I assigned a new deck to each player.

I think I finally figured out the problem there, but I broke the program :/

I am pretty sure the problem is somewhere in my Game class. Any ideas?


[sourcecode language="ruby"]
require_relative 'player'
class Game
  attr_reader :hand
  attr_accessor :make_game
  def initialize numplayers
    @numplayers = numplayers
    hand = []
  end
  def make_game
    i = 0
    while i &lt; @numplayers
    hand &lt;&lt; Player.new()
    i+=1
    end
  end
end
[/sourcecode]
