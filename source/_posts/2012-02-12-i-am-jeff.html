Welcome to my new website, where we get to learn cool stuff together! I have spent a lifetime in school learning jack shit. Everything I've learned, for real, I taught myself or learned on the job.

That is what we are going to take a stab at on this site. I am going to pick a skill and then I'm going to teach myself said skill. I will then post how-to guides, instructional videos, detailed accounts of my mistakes, and (sometimes) funny anecdotes of the learning experience.

Sound fun? I hope so.

So a little about me:
<ul>
	<li>I am an undergraduate student in the entrepreneurship program at University of South Florida St. Petersburg.</li>
	<li>I worked on ships (no not cruise ships, the ones that bring all those products from China that you like)</li>
	<li>I've started three companies</li>
	<li>I just got engaged to the most wonderful woman in the world</li>
	<li>I read. A lot.</li>
	<li>I like to teach</li>
	<li>New is exciting</li>
	<li>I love learning</li>
</ul>
Okay, I won't talk much more about myself from here on out, but I thought you should know the man behind the curtain.

As this website progresses I would love to field suggestions on topics to cover so jump in on the comments :)
