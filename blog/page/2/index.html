  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was learning to play the piano, I remember wanting to jump right into Billy Joel. “Hot Cross Buns” and “Mary Had a Little Lamb” were boring and very uncool for an eight year old boy to be learning.</p>




<p>I have had the same feeling while learning to code. I spent a lot of time doing methods, objects and classes never really getting to use them as I would in the real world.</p>




<p>There is one question I wanted to be able answer since the day I started programming: “How the hell do I interact with a program?”</p>




<p>Today, I figured that out.  The code below is from the main program file for the game I created in the <a href="http://online.pragmaticstudio.com/courses/ruby">Pragmatic Studios course</a>. In it, there are two examples of some of ruby’s basic input functions.</p>




<pre><code>knuckleheads = StudioGame::Game.new(&amp;quot;Knuckleheads&amp;quot;)

default_player_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'players.csv')
knuckleheads.load_players(ARGV.shift || default_player_file)

loop do
  puts &amp;quot;\nHow many game rounds do you want to play?&amp;quot;
  answer = gets.downcase.chomp
  case answer
  when /^\d+$/
    knuckleheads.play(answer.to_i)
  when 'quit','exit'
    knuckleheads.print_stats
    break
  else
    puts &amp;quot;Please enter a number or 'quit'&amp;quot;
  end
end

knuckleheads.save_high_scores
</code></pre>




<p>The first input I learned was the “gets” method. Here, the program prompts the user to provide a number, the code checks that it is in fact a number (or a quit command) and then uses the number as an argument for the method.</p>




<pre><code>loop do
  puts &amp;quot;\nHow many game rounds do you want to play?&amp;quot;
  answer = gets.downcase.chomp
  case answer
  when /^\d+$/
    knuckleheads.play(answer.to_i)
  when 'quit','exit'
    knuckleheads.print_stats
    break
  else
    puts &amp;quot;Please enter a number or 'quit'&amp;quot;
  end
</code></pre>




<p>The next one is a little more complicated so I will try to break it up into pieces.</p>




<p>What I am trying to accomplish is to allow non-programmers to add players to my game using a csv file and no code. They should be able to simply input the name of a player and the program automatically adds a Player object to the game.</p>




<p>To do this I created a player.csv file (in the above code a person could theoretically create their own file and load it in) with a series of players each on their own line. Then I included the following code in my Game class:</p>




<pre><code>  def load_players (filename=&amp;quot;players.csv&amp;quot;)
    CSV.foreach(filename) do |line|
      player = Player.new(line[0], line[1].to_i)
      add_player(player)
    end
  end
</code></pre>




<p>This takes a file (defaulted with my players.csv) and goes through each line of the file, creating a Player object for each one.</p>




<p>Then, I included this in the main program file:</p>




<pre><code>default_player_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'players.csv')
knuckleheads.load_players(ARGV.shift || default_player_file)
</code></pre>




<p>This loaded the players from the file given by the user or my default file if none is give and then runs the program as normal.</p>




<p>So, after two months of hard work and a steep learning curve I have completed my first gem! w00t! You can download it if you want:</p>




<p>$gem install blam_and_woot</p>




<p>If you want to peek at the source code you can find it<a href="https://github.com/jeffreybaird/blam_and_woot">here</a></p>




<p>I will be writing about packaging the gem and some issues I ran into with that later. For now, I am celebrating!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Full of the knowledge gained from <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb/events/60266012/" target="_blank">Coder Night</a> on Thursday, I made an attempt at creating a poker game. My original plan was to create three classes, a Player class, a Deck class and a Game class. The general construction of the game would be the Game class would use take a new deck object and pop the last card out of the shuffled array and assign it to one of the players in the array “hand”</p>




<p>The first problem I ran into was getting each player cards from the same deck. When I wrote the program the first time I assigned a new deck to each player.</p>




<p>I think I finally figured out the problem there, but I broke the program :/</p>




<p>I am pretty sure the problem is somewhere in my Game class. Any ideas?</p>




<pre><code>require_relative 'player'
class Game
  attr_reader :hand
  attr_accessor :make_game
  def initialize numplayers
    @numplayers = numplayers
    hand = []
  end
  def make_game
    i = 0
    while i &amp;lt; @numplayers
    hand &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Player.new()
    i+=1
    end
  end
end

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>I’m coming back now, I promise</h2>


<p>I’m sorry, audience of zero, I haven’t been updating you on my learning process or helping you keep up. The problem is, I have been moving way too fast to write about it every day. So, to update you:</p>

<h3>HTML:</h3>


<p>While I am no master, I plowed through my HTML book and felt comfortable enough to move on.</p>

<h3>CSS:</h3>


<p>I know the concepts of CSS, I know what it can do and I know where to look up commands, I think I will get better by doing.</p>

<p>So the blog originally was for you to learn with me and I dropped the ball on keeping up with it. Sorry.</p>

<p>So, Where am I now?</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>


<p>I have been playing around with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> for a few months now and I love it. The exercises are challenging and you have a lot of freedom to mess around. It was a great intro to programming and I have since expanded my pursuits!</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>


<p>Through the urging of my wonderful friends <a href="http://redheadjessica.com/">Jessica Barnett</a> and <a href="http://aubreygoodman.wordpress.com/">Aubrey Goodman</a>, I decided to pursue Ruby. I love it. Actually love is a gross understatement. When I sleep, I have dreams of objects and methods dancing in my head (you think I’m joking).</p>

<p>I am currently working my way through the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program">Learn to Program by Chris Pine</a> (highly recommend) and a course offered by <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby">Pragmatic Studios</a> (equally awesome).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I don’t want to do anything else but program in Ruby for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>General Computer Science</h3>


<p>For this I am reading <a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=debautblo-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=0071460519">Schaum’s Outline</a> which moves really fast but is completely worth the effort. I think this will prepare me well for some further exploration into algorithms and databases.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>


<p>I am also going through<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111"> Standford’s Intro to Programming Methodology and Computer Science </a>class to hopefully give me some training in larger theories and best practices of software design.</p>

<p>So, yes I am busy. I will however try to post more often with some tidbits, challenges and advice I pick up along the way. I hope you continue to read!</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; let the browser know where the html document begins and ends</p>

<p>&lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; starts and ends the page “head”</p>

<p>&lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; Gives the page a title</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; starts and ends the “body” of the document.</p>

<p>&lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; changes the formatting of the enclosed text to the size of  heading 1</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; shows when a paragraph begins and ends</p>

<p>&lt;h2&gt; and &lt;/h2&gt; Same as heading 1 except slightly smaller.  There is a total of 6 heading sizes</p>

<h2>Today’s Lesson</h2>


<h3>Setting up your website</h3>


<p>In order to begin creating your website you have to first choose a text editor. If you have a Mac you can use TextEdit. If you have a PC, Notepad comes standard. Thanks to <a href="http://www.redheadjessica.com">Jessica</a> I will be using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> which is a text editor made specially for developers.</p>

<p>So open up the text editor of your choice and make sure that it is set to a plain text format (not necessary if using TextMate)</p>

<br>Save the file as “index.html” to a folder called “learnwithjeff.”




<br>Now, try creating a file like the one I did in my <a title="A Quick Look at HTML and Your First Assignment" href="http://www.learnwithjeff.com/2012/02/16/a-quick-look-at-html-and-your-first-assignment/">previous post</a>. Once you have finished open the file using your browser and check out your first HTML website!

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>Today we are going to look at a little basic HTML. I’m running behind so this will be a short post.</p>

<p>This is what a (super) basic HTML file looks like:</p>

<p> </p>

<pre><code>
  `<html>
    <head> This is the Header </head>
    <body>
      <p> This is a paragraph in the body of the html</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Disclaimer:</h2>

<p>Third post in and I’ve already made an executive decision about this blog, it is about me. I know this may sound a bit selfish. I am okay with that.</p>

<p>I want you to read, follow along and learn with me. I will answer all questions as best I can. I won’t, however, choose what I teach based on popular demand. I want to learn, so I won’t cover things I already know.</p>

<p>So, on that note, we are not going to go over WordPress today like I had originally planned. We are going to go straight into HTML.</p>

<p>Now I know a little HTML but I figure it can’t hurt to get a little refresher so I will start from the beginning.</p>

<h2>HTML:</h2>

<p>I got my book in the mail, <a href="" title="http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/">Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML</a>. It looks pretty basic and seems like a lot of fun (Lots of pictures). I will try to explain everything as best I can but I will always refer back to the book. If you want to follow along I would suggest purchasing it.</p>

<p>So let us first delve into the basics of HyperText Markup Language or HTML for short. To do that we need to first take a look at where it fits into the equation of the internet.</p>

<p>HTML is the language your browser understands. When you make a website you load HTML file(s) onto a web server. A web server is just a computer that stays on, connected to the internet.</p>

<p>When you visit a website you are sending a request to the server to send you that HTML file. Your browser than interprets all the HTML tags (certain words surrounded by &lt;…>), and displays websites as you know them.</p>

<p><img csrc = "images/circleofweb.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="603"></p>

<p> </p>

<br>So now we know where HTML fits into the web in general. It is a language that browsers use to determine the structure of a website. Next lesson, basic HTML tags.


<p>See you next time :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="entry-content">I’ve done a lot of cool things in my short 24 years. I’m proud of my accomplishments and I want to show them off to future employers, partners and investors. To do this, I am making an online resume.

First, I need a url. To do this you need to find an available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" target="_blank">domain name</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar" target="_blank">domain registration company</a>.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.fatcow.com" target="_blank">Fat Cow</a> - I love this website. It handles my domain registration as well as my hosting. It has one click Word Press installation, unlimited storage and a free domain name. It may not be the best in the market but I have been very happy with them.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to my new website, where we get to learn cool stuff together! I have spent a lifetime in school learning jack shit. Everything I’ve learned, for real, I taught myself or learned on the job.</p>

<p>That is what we are going to take a stab at on this site. I am going to pick a skill and then I’m going to teach myself said skill. I will then post how-to guides, instructional videos, detailed accounts of my mistakes, and (sometimes) funny anecdotes of the learning experience.</p>

<p>Sound fun? I hope so.</p>

<p>So a little about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am an undergraduate student in the entrepreneurship program at University of South Florida St. Petersburg.</li>
    <li>I worked on ships (no not cruise ships, the ones that bring all those products from China that you like)</li>
    <li>I’ve started three companies</li>
    <li>I just got engaged to the most wonderful woman in the world</li>
    <li>I read. A lot.</li>
